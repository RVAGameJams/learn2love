# Up and running

Learning by making is fun and effective.
Learning to interface with other people's software is part of being a programmer and is a necessary skill to have as one.
[LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) is a framework for making games.
A framework is just a set of tools or functionality combined together to serve a larger purpose.
In the case of LÖVE this includes, but is not limited to:

- Functions for loading images, audio, and text
- Functions for creating and moving objects
- Parameters for making the objects interact

## Installing your development environment

The LÖVE website has links to install the software on your system.
If you have LÖVE installed already, make sure that you at least version 11 (mysterious mysteries) as some functionality we'll cover here doesn't exist in older versions.
For mobile devices you can find a copy in the app store.

Along with installing LÖVE, you will need a text editor for creating Lua files on your system. I'm not going to make any recommendations here, because in the end it all comes down to personal preference, but you can check [this list](https://github.com/love2d-community/awesome-love2d/blob/master/README.md#ides) by the LÖVE community if you need a starting point. It features different editors (and recommended plugins) for LÖVE and Lua development. Simply pick one.

## Test that LÖVE runs

When you launch LÖVE, (see instructions below on how to do that) you will be greeted with a friendly graphic and the text "NO GAME", meaning you are running the engine but didn't give it a game to load.

### OSX and other posix systems

If your system created a shortcut, run that.
Otherwise you can open the terminal on your system and run the command:
```sh
love
```

### Windows

If a shortcut for LÖVE didn't appear in the start menu, you should be able to type "love" in the search and see it.

## Create a project folder

Find a safe place to create a folder and give it the name "hello".
Within the folder, create a new text file named "main.lua".
This will be where our game's code goes.

**Note for Windows:**
In order to create a file with the name "main.lua", you may need to first create a new "Text Document", right-click on it, click "Properties" then from the properties menu change the file extension from reading "main.lua.txt" to just "main.lua".

## Create a test game

Within "main.lua", write out the following function:

```lua
love.draw = function()
  love.graphics.print('Hello World!', 400, 300)
end
```

Now let's figure out how to run it and see what it does.

## Run the game

This will be different for different operating systems.

### OSX and other posix systems

Open the terminal and navigate to the "hello" folder:
```sh
cd /path/to/your/game
ls # Should display "main.lua" if you're in the correct directory.
```

This will let LÖVE know the game is in this folder.
Now run LÖVE:

```sh
love .
```

The `.` (period) means "current location", so you're telling LÖVE that the game is in this location we're currently in.
If the game ran successfully, you will see a black window with the text "Hello world!" in small print.

### Windows

Find the shortcut to LÖVE and drag and drop it in the game folder like so:

![](/images/02-01-windows-folder.png)

Then right-click on the LÖVE shortcut and you will see a "Properties" dialog window similar to this:

![](/images/02-01-windows-shortcut.png)

The "Target" field may be the same or slightly different depending on your system version.
Without deleting the text string currently in the "Target" field, append the path to your game folder in quotes to the end.
You can copy and paste this path from the folder's address bar.
For instance the target path in the picture should go from reading:
```
"C:\Program Files\LOVE\love.exe"
```
to
```
"C:\Program Files\LOVE\love.exe" "C:\Users\IEUser\Desktop\hello"
```

Now press "OK" to close the Properties dialog and clicking the shortcut will launch the game.
If the game ran successfully, you will see a black window with the text "Hello world!" in small print.

## Congratulations!

You've set up your development environment for writing a game in Lua.
If you had issues getting through this, reach out to me either through a GitHub issue or my contact information and I will update this guide to including any additional troubleshooting steps for future users.


Now that our development environment is set up and our first game is running, try modifying the code so the string "Hello World!" reads something different.
It's pretty apparent that running this function prints to the screen whatever string we give it.
But what are the 2nd and 3rd parameters for?

```lua
  love.graphics.print('Hello World!', 400, 300)
```

Try modifying those numbers and see what it does to the text.
